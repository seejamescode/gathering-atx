            The Gathering ATX has launched on campus at UT Austin by a
            collective of ATX leaders, students, and friends hosting pop-up
            campus-wide gatherings of worship and word in the round in the heart
            of campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            These unique nights of worship are formed in a partnership with a
            collective of artists and worship leaders from several ministries
            and churches around Austin, in the hope to make much of the name of
            Jesus at UT Austin while encouraging and supporting existing
            ministries and students on campus. Each night is composed "in the
            round,‚Äù by minimizing a stage and stripping back production,
            bringing everyone together, and circling back to the heart of
            worship: a centering on Jesus.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of The Gathering ATX is the prayer of Jesus in John 17
            that all believers would be one. These nights are put together out
            of the generosity of many friends of Jesus for various moments
            throughout the semester to worship Jesus, pray for each other and
            the campus, and at times perhaps even hear briefly from different
            leaders serving UT Austin and city.
          </p>
